# LSTM Next Word Prediction

A deep learning model that predicts the next word in a sequence using LSTM neural networks.

## 📌 What This Project Does
This model reads questions and answers, learns patterns in the text, and predicts what word should come next. It's like your phone's keyboard suggestions but more advanced.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **PyTorch** - For building the neural network
- **LSTM** - Type of neural network good for text
- **tiktoken** - To convert text to numbers (tokenization)
- **Pandas & NumPy** - For data handling
